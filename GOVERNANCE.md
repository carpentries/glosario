# Governance

This project uses [Martha's Rules][marthas-rules] for making decisions.  The
first section below describes these rules; the second lists voting members of
the project and explains how to become one, while the third lists decisions made
to date.

## Making Decisions

1.  Before each meeting, anyone who wishes may sponsor a proposal by filing an
    issue in the GitHub repository tagged "proposal".  Proposals must be filed
    at least 24 hours before a meeting in order to be considered at that
    meeting, and must include:
    -   a one-line summary (the subject line of the issue)
    -   the full text of the proposal
    -   any required background information
    -   pros and cons
    -   possible alternatives

2.  A quorum is established in a meeting if half or more of voting members are
    present.

3.  Once a person has sponsored a proposal, they are responsible for it.  The
    group may not discuss or vote on the issue unless the sponsor or their
    delegate is present.  The sponsor is also responsible for presenting the
    item to the group.

4.  After the sponsor presents the proposal, a sense vote is cast for the
    proposal prior to any discussion:
    -   Who likes the proposal?
    -   Who can live with the proposal?
    -   Who is uncomfortable with the proposal?

5.  If all of the group likes or can live with the proposal, it is immediately
    accepted with no further discussion.

6.  If most of the group is uncomfortable with the proposal, it is postponed for
    further rework by the sponsor.

7.  If any members are uncomfortable:
    1.  They can briefly state their objections and tell the facilitator how
        much time they reasonably require to make comments.
    1.  The facilitator then sets a time limit for discussion at 10 minutes
        plus whatever upward adjustment needed to meet any special needs
        participants may have.
    1.  After the allotted time or when no one has anything further to add
        (whichever comes first), the facilitator calls for a yes-or-no vote on
        the question: "Should we implement this decision over the stated
        objections?"
    1.  If a majority votes "yes" the proposal is implemented.  Otherwise, the
        proposal is returned to the sponsor for further work.

## Suffrage

1.  The following people are currently voting members of this project:
    -   [Ian Flores Siaca](https://ianfs.dev/)
    -   [Zhian Kamvar](https://zkamvar.netlify.app/)
    -   [Fran√ßois Michonneau](https://francoismichonneau.net/)
    -   [Greg Wilson](http://third-bit.com/)

2.  To become a voting member:
    1.  A current member must sponsor a proposal to add the candidate.
    2.  That proposal must pass as outlined in the "Making Decisions" section of
        this page.

3.  Voting members may resign from the project at any time, or lose their vote
    if a proposal to that effect is passed as outlined in the "Making Decisions"
    section of this page.
    1.  A proposal to remove someone's vote may not contain any other business.
    2.  Each person must be the subject of a separate proposal.
    3.  The person in question has the right to vote on the proposal to remove
        their vote.

## Recording Decisions

Proposals that have been accepted are listed below in reverse chronological
order. Each entry must contain:

-   the date the proposal was accepted,
-   the proposal's one-line summary, and
-   a link to the proposal issue in GitHub.
